This program has basic functionality. It uses a sliding window of 1 without errors. 
General functionality is complete, and there are not any modules that are not working.

The program may be started by first unzipping all source files to the desired folder. Then, a
command of 'make' or 'make all' will compile the executables for the client and server, which
can be run using './client <server name>' and './server' respectively. If the server name is
not specified when launching the client, it will assume localhost.

The following commands are included in this program:

*addbodyphoto
addphoto
*adduser
*createbody
createmissing
*dlmissingphoto
help
*id
locations
login
*password
*removebody
*removemissing
query
quit

* commands require login first

The exact syntax and required parameters for each of the commands can be obtained by typing in only the command.
The above list of commands is accessed by typing 'help'.

Changes in Design:

Added payload length field in packets and frames
